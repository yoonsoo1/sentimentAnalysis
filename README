This is my implementation of interpreting the iMDB sentiment data with PyTorch.

I built the data pipeline so that any NLP model can be ran through with the same
data processing pipeline. If one wants to change the model to use, all they
need to do is add a function similar to setUpRNN or setUpLSTM in the main.py. 
In this set up, we must specify the model and the loss function that we want to use. 

The main goal of the project was to compare pros and cons of using the RNN model vs
the LSTM model. The LSTM does a much better job for its binary accuracy and loss
when ran for a long time, but the RNN is a light weight model that can run many
epochs in a short amount of time.

With the LSTM, the project achieved over 70% binary accuracy. There are some
hyperparameter adjustments that needs to be done to increase the accuracy.

The future improvements are specified as comments in main.py.
